        <div class="col">Liseberg is an amusement park located in Gothenburg, Sweden, that opened in 1923. It is the largest amusement park in Scandinavia by area and one of the largest in number of visitors with about three million visitors annually. Among the noteworthy attractions is the wooden roller coaster Balder, twice (2003 and 2005) voted as the Best Wooden Tracked Roller Coaster in the world in a major international poll. The park itself has also been chosen as one of the top ten amusement parks in the world (2005) by Forbes magazine and second best in Europe (2022)by IAAPA.
            In addition to the summer season, the park is also open during October to December, albeit with fewer rides operating, hosting a Halloween season with various houses of horrors and a Christmas market, with traditional Swedish cuisine such as mulled wine and specialties such as d√∂ner kebab made from reindeer meat.
            The official colors of Liseberg are pink and green as can be seen on the entrance and the older houses in the park; the colors were also adopted for the logo, which was introduced in the 1980s, but changed in 2013 to the current logo. </div>
